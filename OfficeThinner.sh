# Tested on Office version 15.16 (151105)
# Tested on Office version 15.17 (151206)
# Use at your own risk.

# Some large-sized duplicate files exist in Word.app, Excel.app, PowerPoint.app, Outlook.app and OneNote.app in Office 2016 for Mac.
# It's wasting your precious HDD/SSD space as these files are just 5 duplicate copies in these apps.
# This script moves some of the duplicate files from Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote into a backup directory, and then soft link neccesary paths back to the real files in Word.app alone.
