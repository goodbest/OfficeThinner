## Attention!
- This script is only for `Office 2016 for Mac`, tested on 
  - version `15.16 (151105)`
  - version `15.17 (151206)`
  - version `15.18 (160109)`
- Use at your own risk.
- Read the code before you run.
- Make sure all the 5 Office Apps are in the same version.

## Usage
```
sudo bash -c "curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goodbest/OfficeThinner/master/OfficeThinner.sh | bash"
```
- As Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac is installed with `root` on `/Applications`, you have to run this script with `sudo`.
- The backup files are located at `~/Desktop/OfficeThinner`, you can do whatever you like with them if everything is fine.
- Everytime after you install Microsoft Office Updates, you may have to re-run this script. 

## Explain
Some large-sized duplicate files exist in `Word.app`, `Excel.app`, `PowerPoint.app`, `Outlook.app` and `OneNote.app` in Office 2016 for Mac.

It's wasting your precious HDD/SSD space as these files are just 5 duplicate copies in these apps.

This script moves the following duplicate files from Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote into a backup directory on your desktop (you may later delete them safely), and then soft link neccesary paths back to the real files in Word.app alone.
